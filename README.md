# Vietnamese Traditional Game

Welcome to the Vietnamese Traditional Game project! This repository contains a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that showcases a traditional Vietnamese game.

## Game Description

The game featured in this project is a traditional Vietnamese game, the name of which can be specified as "X√≥c ƒêƒ©a". In this game, players will engage in a set of activities that mimic the rules and mechanics of the actual traditional game. The game's objective and rules will be outlined in the project documentation or within the code itself.


## How to Play

To play the game, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser that supports HTML5 and JavaScript. Once the page loads, follow the instructions on the screen to start the game and interact with the game elements. The game may include buttons, inputs, or other interactive elements that you can use to make your moves or decisions.
